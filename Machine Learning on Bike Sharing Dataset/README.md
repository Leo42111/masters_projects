# Machine Learning on Bike Sharing Dataset
This project is from one of my statistical machine learning courses. The dataset used is Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Data Set from UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Seoul+Bike+Sharing+Demand. Since bike-sharing is getting more popular, I think it is interesting to predict the daily bike-sharing demand, which I have done in this project. I have pre-processed the data, explored the data, and made predictions using KNN Regression, Linear Regression, PCR, PLS, Polynomial Regression, and SVR.
