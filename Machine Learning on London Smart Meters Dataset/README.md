# Machine Learning on London Smart Meters Dataset
This project is from my Data Analytics in Smart Cities courses. The dataset used is the "Smart meters in London" dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jeanmidev/smart-meters-in-london?select=acorn_details.csv. Some data pre-processing has been done (the code is not included in this folder). I have first performed exploratory data analysis and tried to predict the daily & hourly energy consumption using Linear Regression, Forward, Backward & Best Subset Selection, Lasso & Ridge Regression, and KNN Regression. Also, I have done some additional exploratory data analysis on the original data source (London Datastore) with tariffs https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/smartmeter-energy-use-data-in-london-households to compare the electricity consumption between the Dynamic Time of Use (dToU) energy plan users and ordinary users.
