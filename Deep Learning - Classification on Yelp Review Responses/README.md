# Deep Learning - Classification on Yelp Review Responses
This project is from my Deep Learning course. This project uses the Yelp Open Dataset at https://www.yelp.com/dataset (I am not the owner of this dataset, and this folder does not include any data). First, I have performed some data pre-processing (I did not put those codes in this folder). Then, I have tried to use a mixed model (linear layers to handle non-text data and pre-trained DistilBERT model to handle review text) to predict the review responses (useful/funny/cool). Due to the heavily right-skewed Y distribution, I have modeled the task to a 3-class classification task (0-1; 2-4; >4) instead of a regression task. This folder contains the model and training codes. The code is implemented using Python with PyTorch.
