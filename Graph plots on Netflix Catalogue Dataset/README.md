# Graph plots on Netflix Catalogue Dataset
This project is from my exploratory data analysis course. The dataset used the "Netflix Movies and TV Shows" Dataset in Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows?select=netflix_titles.csv. I have extracted the listed_in column (the category of movies/films) and created two separate graph plots to show the relationships between categories. Each node represents a listed_in label, and each edge represents the co-occurrence of two listed_in tags in the same show. The weight of edges means the co-occurrence count. I used Gephi to create the graphs.
